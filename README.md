In this project I will attempt to recreate the google home page. I intend to hone my git skills as well as my html and css abilities.

1.

Done:
 Added the Google logo, the search input form and centered it. Added navbar, flaoted ul element to the right, made li elements inline so that they could be displayed side by side. 

Issues:
 After floating ul to the right there is not enough width in the ul element to display li elements side by side.
 Search div is overlapping the navbar div.
 Input field is no longer centered.

 2.

 Done:
  Added both buttons with correct styling and text under buttons. Properly aligned navbar and everything else to my screen size.

Issues:
 None at the moment.

 3.

 Done:
 Added footer and pushed it to the bottom with position: fixed and bottom: 0. Decided to conclude the project here because anything else would be just slight tweaks to perfect the page. Only thing I could have done better is styling the search box to resemble googles one a bit more, I also could have fixed the curser that shows up inside the search box beuse it overflows out of the search box.
